Developed an interactive dashboard to analyze employee performance for INX Future Inc, focusing on data analytics and automation solutions. The analysis revealed that job satisfaction and salary hike percentage are major factors influencing performance, particularly among young employees aged 26-35 in roles such as Sales Executive and Developer. To address this, it is recommended that Mr. Brain, CEO of INX Future Inc, increases the salary hike percentage to over 15% for these young employees who have at least two years of experience with the company.
